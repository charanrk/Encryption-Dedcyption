# Encryption-Dedcyption

Description
This Python program implements a basic Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption technique. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

**Getting Started
Prerequisites**
Python 3.x

**Installation**
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>

**Navigate to the project directory:**
bash
Copy code
cd caesar-cipher

**Usage**
Run the program by executing the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
python caesar_cipher.py
Follow the prompts to choose between encryption and decryption and provide the necessary inputs:

**Enter 'E' for encryption or 'D' for decryption.**
If encrypting:
Enter the plaintext to encrypt.
Enter the key (shift value).
If decrypting:
Enter the ciphertext to decrypt.
Enter the key (shift value).
